# Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI

This chapter introduces you to the fundamentals of Physical AI - AI systems that interact with the physical world through sensors, actuators, and real-world applications.

## Overview

Physical AI represents a critical intersection between artificial intelligence and the physical world. Unlike traditional AI systems that operate primarily in digital spaces, Physical AI systems must perceive, reason about, and act upon real-world environments. This chapter will explore:

- What makes Physical AI different from traditional AI
- Real-world applications of Physical AI systems
- The core components of Physical AI systems
- How Physical AI systems integrate sensing, reasoning, and acting

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- Define Physical AI and distinguish it from traditional AI systems
- Identify real-world applications of Physical AI
- Recognize the core components of Physical AI systems
- Understand the perception-action loop in Physical AI systems

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this chapter, you should have:

- Basic programming knowledge (any language)
- Familiarity with fundamental AI concepts (optional but helpful)
- A curiosity about how AI systems interact with the physical world

## Chapter Structure

This chapter is divided into three lessons:

1. **Lesson 1.1: Foundations of Physical AI** - Overview of what Physical AI is, how it differs from traditional AI, and examples of real-world applications
2. **Lesson 1.2: Sensors and Perception** - Understanding how AI systems perceive the physical world through various sensors (cameras, lidar, radar, etc.)
3. **Lesson 1.3: Actuators and Control** - Learning how AI systems interact with the physical world through actuators and control systems

## Next Steps

Start with Lesson 1.1 to understand the foundations of Physical AI, then continue with the subsequent lessons to build a comprehensive understanding of how AI systems interact with the physical world.
