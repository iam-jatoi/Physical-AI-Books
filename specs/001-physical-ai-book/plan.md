# Implementation Plan: Physical AI Book

**Branch**: `001-physical-ai-book` | **Date**: 2025-12-24 | **Spec**: [D:\Hackathon\specs\001-physical-ai-book\spec.md]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

This plan outlines the development of a comprehensive Physical AI Book using Docusaurus as the documentation platform. The book will follow the constitution's principles of hands-on learning, beginner-friendly approach, and modular content design. It will include 1 chapter with 3 lessons as specified, with proper Docusaurus organization and navigation.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Markdown, JavaScript/TypeScript (Docusaurus v3+)
**Primary Dependencies**: Docusaurus 3.x, Node.js 18+, React 18+, npm/yarn
**Storage**: Git repository with static content files
**Testing**: Jest for unit tests, Cypress for end-to-end tests, content validation scripts
**Target Platform**: Web-based documentation site, responsive for desktop and mobile
**Project Type**: Static documentation site
**Performance Goals**: <2s page load time, <100ms search response, SEO-optimized
**Constraints**: 
- Content must be accessible to readers with only basic Python programming knowledge
- All code examples must run in standard Python environments or clearly documented simulation frameworks
- Book size limited to 300 pages maximum to maintain focus and accessibility
- All tools and libraries used must be open-source or have free-tier access for educational purposes
- Content must be deployable using Docusaurus without requiring complex server infrastructure
**Scale/Scope**: 1 chapter with 3 lessons initially, with capability for expansion to full book

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **Principle I (Hands-On Learning First)**: PASS - Plan includes executable code examples and simulation exercises
- **Principle II (Beginner-Friendly Approach)**: PASS - Plan uses clear explanations and visual aids
- **Principle III (Docusaurus Documentation Excellence)**: PASS - Plan leverages Docusaurus features for navigation and search
- **Principle IV (Modular Content Design)**: PASS - Plan structures content in self-contained lessons
- **Principle V (Real-World Application Focus)**: PASS - Plan includes case studies from robotics and autonomous systems
- **Principle VI (Progressive Complexity)**: PASS - Plan follows structured progression from fundamentals to advanced topics
