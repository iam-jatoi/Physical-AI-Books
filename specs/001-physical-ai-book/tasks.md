- [X] T026 [US1] Verify lesson content follows beginner-friendly approach
- [X] T027 [US1] Test that users can access and read the first chapter

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Navigate Book Content Systematically (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Enable users to navigate through the book content in a logical sequence that builds upon previous knowledge

**Independent Test Criteria**: Users can follow the book from start to finish and successfully complete each lesson before moving to the next

- [X] T028 [US2] Enhance navigation structure in sidebars.js for systematic progression
- [X] T029 [US2] Add "Next Lesson" and "Previous Lesson" navigation links
- [ ] T030 [US2] Implement cross-linking between related concepts in lessons

- [X] T034 [US2] Add search bar to all pages
- [X] T035 [US2] Test navigation flow from lesson 1.1 to 1.3
- [X] T036 [US2] Verify users can jump to specific topics and return to previous sections

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Access Hands-On Learning Materials (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Enable users to access practical examples, code samples, and exercises that they can run and modify

**Independent Test Criteria**: Users can execute code examples, modify them, and see expected results that reinforce the learning objectives

- [X] T037 [US3] Add code examples to Lesson 1.1 (Foundations of Physical AI)
- [X] T038 [P] [US3] Add code examples to Lesson 1.2 (Sensors and Perception)
- [X] T039 [P] [US3] Add code examples to Lesson 1.3 (Actuators and Control)
- [X] T040 [US3] Create CodeBlock component with copy and run functionality
- [X] T041 [US3] Add exercise descriptions to each lesson

## Dependencies

**User Story 2 depends on**: User Story 1 (navigation requires content to exist)
**User Story 3 depends on**: User Story 1 (exercises require lesson content)

**Critical Path**:
Setup → Foundational → US1 → US2 → US3 → Polish

**Parallel Execution Opportunities**:
- T019-T021: Creating the three lessons can happen in parallel
- T037-T039: Adding code examples to lessons can happen in parallel
